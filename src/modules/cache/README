After openlitespeed installed, there should be a file cache.so in LSWS_HOME/modules/.

If it is not there, there should be some error occured.

You may want to compile and build it with the Makefile.f with the command

make -f Makefile.f

If still does not work, try "gmake" instead of "make".

About how to config the cache module, please refer to

Thanks and enjoy.
